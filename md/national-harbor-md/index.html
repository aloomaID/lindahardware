                    <h2>Why Pea Gravel is Ideal for Miami's Climate</h2>
                    <p>Pea gravel is an excellent choice for landscaping in National Harbor Maryland offering both functional and aesthetic benefits that align with the region's unique climate. Miami’s hot, humid environment can challenge traditional landscaping materials, but pea gravel stands out due to its durability and versatility.<br>One of the main advantages of pea gravel in National Harbor Maryland  is its heat resistance. Miami's scorching summers and intense sunlight can cause some landscaping materials to crack, fade, or deteriorate. Pea gravel, however, remains intact and vibrant under harsh weather conditions, making it a long-lasting option for your outdoor spaces. Its small, smooth stones provide excellent drainage, which is especially important in National Harbor Maryland  where heavy rains and humidity are frequent. This drainage helps prevent waterlogging and erosion, ensuring that your landscaping stays intact and healthy year-round.<br>Additionally, pea gravel offers a low-maintenance solution. Its natural composition means it doesn’t require frequent upkeep like grass or mulch. Simply adding a fresh layer of pea gravel every few years can keep your landscaping looking new and pristine. It’s also highly customizable, with a variety of colors and textures that can complement any design, from contemporary patios to rustic garden paths.<br>Whether you're creating a driveway, garden bed, or decorative pathway in National Harbor Maryland pea gravel’s adaptability to different landscapes and climates makes it a top choice for homeowners seeking both beauty and practicality.</p>

                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The land developed for National Harbor was previously Salubria Plantation, built in 1827 by Dr. John H. Bayne. The plantation house burned down in 1981 and was offered for sale along with the surrounding land. The land was sold in 1984 and in 1994 was rezoned for mixed-use development. In the fall of 1997, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Army Corps of Engineers approved new developer permits, granted for the PortAmerica project in 1988.</p>
