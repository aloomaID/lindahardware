This drainage helps prevent waterlogging and erosion, ensuring that your landscaping stays intact and healthy year-round.<br>Additionally, pea gravel offers a low-maintenance solution. Its natural composition means it doesn’t require frequent upkeep like grass or mulch. Simply adding a fresh layer of pea gravel every few years can keep your landscaping looking new and pristine. It’s also highly customizable, with a variety of colors and textures that can complement any design, from contemporary patios to rustic garden paths.<br>Whether you're creating a driveway, garden bed, or decorative pathway in Ohkay Owingeh New Mexico pea gravel’s adaptability to different landscapes and climates makes it a top choice for homeowners seeking both beauty and practicality.</p>
