Known for its smooth, rounded appearance, pea gravel is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional, making it an excellent choice for a variety of outdoor applications.<br>In Boulder Montana where the weather can fluctuate between heavy rains and intense heat, pea gravel provides excellent drainage.

                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Established in the 19th century as a stagecoach station, Boulder grew into a regional trading center for farmers, ranchers, and miners and, by the end of that century, home to state schools for the deaf, blind and developmentally disabled. In the 21st century, it is the center of government in Jefferson County, and institutions based in the town offer services for disabled adults and troubled youths. Its library system serves about 10,000 people, and its high school district covers more than 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2). Three buildings in Boulder are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
