            <p>The HOVE development consisted of 10,697 1-acre (4,000 m2) lots north of the Hawaii Belt Road in the western part of the District of Kaʻū. The terrain varies from rugged lava fields to ohiʻa trees and other vegetation. Elevation ranges from about 1,500 ft (460 m) up to the 5,000-foot (1,500 m) level. Initial sales began in the late 1950s. The original developer of HOVE was the Crawford Oil Company. Later, other subdivisions were put in place downslope of HOVE and the Hawaii Belt Road. In the early 1980s a service station and a hardware store were built.</p>
