                    <p>Pea gravel is a versatile and practical choice for landscaping and construction in Parkland Florida offering multiple benefits that make it ideal for the region's unique climate. Known for its smooth, rounded appearance, pea gravel is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional, making it an excellent choice for a variety of outdoor applications.<br>In Parkland Florida where the weather can fluctuate between heavy rains and intense heat, pea gravel provides excellent drainage. The small, loose stones allow water to flow through easily, preventing pooling or flooding that can damage plants and property.

            <p>Parkland's zoning laws are designed to protect the 'park-like' character of the city. There were no stores or traffic lights in Parkland until the mid-1990s and early 2000s when large neighborhood developments (Heron Bay and Parkland Isles) were built. The city of Parkland has been known since its early days for its assortment of park spaces and its emphasis on environmental preservation. For the first few decades of its existence, horses outnumbered the town's population.</p>
