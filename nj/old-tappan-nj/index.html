Known for its smooth, rounded appearance, pea gravel is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional, making it an excellent choice for a variety of outdoor applications.<br>In Old Tappan New Jersey where the weather can fluctuate between heavy rains and intense heat, pea gravel provides excellent drainage.
