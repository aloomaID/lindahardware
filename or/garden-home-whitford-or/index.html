Its natural composition means it doesn’t require frequent upkeep like grass or mulch. Simply adding a fresh layer of pea gravel every few years can keep your landscaping looking new and pristine. It’s also highly customizable, with a variety of colors and textures that can complement any design, from contemporary patios to rustic garden paths.<br>Whether you're creating a driveway, garden bed, or decorative pathway in Garden Home Whitford Oregon pea gravel’s adaptability to different landscapes and climates makes it a top choice for homeowners seeking both beauty and practicality.</p>
