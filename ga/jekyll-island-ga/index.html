                    <h2>Why Pea Gravel is Ideal for Miami's Climate</h2>
                    <p>Pea gravel is a highly versatile and practical landscaping material, especially ideal for the unique climate of Jekyll Island Georgia . This small, rounded aggregate is not only aesthetically pleasing but also offers several benefits that make it a top choice for homeowners and landscapers in areas with hot, humid, and rainy weather, like Jekyll Island Georgia .<br>One of the primary reasons pea gravel is perfect for Jekyll Island Georgia 's climate is its excellent drainage capabilities.

In Jekyll Island Georgia 's hot climate, it provides a cool surface for walking and gardening, reducing the need for constant maintenance. It also retains moisture in garden beds, helping plants thrive during the dry season by conserving water, which is crucial for sustainable landscaping in such a climate.<br>Another advantage of pea gravel is its ability to withstand extreme weather conditions. Its small size and compact nature allow it to resist shifting and displacement during strong winds or heavy storms, which are common in Jekyll Island Georgia . With minimal upkeep, pea gravel provides a durable and attractive surface for your landscaping needs.<br>Whether you are designing a patio, pathway, or drainage solution, pea gravel is an ideal choice for Jekyll Island Georgia  homes, offering both beauty and practicality for various landscaping applications.</p>

            <h3>Jekyll Island, GA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>It was long used seasonally by indigenous peoples of the region. The Guale and the Mocama, the indigenous peoples of the area when Europeans first reached the area, were killed or forced to leave by the English of the Province of Carolina and their native allies, and by raids by French pirates. Plantations were developed on the island during the British colonial period. A few structures still standing are made of tabby, a coastal building material using crushed oyster shells. The island was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was evacuated during World War II by order of the US government. In 1947 the state of Georgia acquired all the property, for security and preservation.</p>
