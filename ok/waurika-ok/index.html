                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>An article from 1985 in The Oklahoman claimed that Waurika promoted itself as 'The Parakeet Capital of the World'. It gave no explanation for using this slogan. The Waurika Chamber of Commerce website in 2020 echoes that the town was 'once a parakeet paradise,' but currently seems to be promoting the motto On The Trail, By The Lake, complete with a logo of a cowboy bronc-riding a fish.</p>
