It also retains moisture in garden beds, helping plants thrive during the dry season by conserving water, which is crucial for sustainable landscaping in such a climate.<br>Another advantage of pea gravel is its ability to withstand extreme weather conditions. Its small size and compact nature allow it to resist shifting and displacement during strong winds or heavy storms, which are common in Belton Missouri . With minimal upkeep, pea gravel provides a durable and attractive surface for your landscaping needs.<br>Whether you are designing a patio, pathway, or drainage solution, pea gravel is an ideal choice for Belton Missouri  homes, offering both beauty and practicality for various landscaping applications.</p>
