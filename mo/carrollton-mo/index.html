Known for its smooth, rounded appearance, pea gravel is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional, making it an excellent choice for a variety of outdoor applications.<br>In Carrollton Missouri where the weather can fluctuate between heavy rains and intense heat, pea gravel provides excellent drainage. The small, loose stones allow water to flow through easily, preventing pooling or flooding that can damage plants and property.
